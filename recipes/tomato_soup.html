        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div style="max-width: 800px;">
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics:</strong>
            Heat olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and carrots. Cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly golden.
        </li>

            <li><strong>Add garlic:</strong> Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>

            <li><strong>Add tomatoes:</strong> Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) and vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20–25 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and the flavors meld.</li>

            <li><strong>Blend:</strong> Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. (Alternatively, carefully transfer to a blender in batches.)</li>

            <li><strong>Add cream:</strong> If using, stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat gently until warmed through.</li>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh basil leaves. Enjoy with crusty bread or grilled cheese!</li>
