                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This classic Neapolitan-style Margherita pizza is simple, fresh, and satisfying.
                    A thin, slightly chewy crust is topped with a bright tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella,
                    and fragrant basil leaves — finished with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or for impressing friends. Use the best
                    quality tomatoes and mozzarella you can find — the recipe's success depends on fresh ingredients.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>500 g (about 4 cups) pizza dough (store-bought or homemade, enough for 2 medium pizzas)</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 g) canned San Marzano tomatoes, crushed (or good-quality pizza sauce)</li>
        <li>250 g fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, a handful</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp fine sea salt (plus extra for seasoning)</li>
        <li>Flour or semolina for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div style="max-width: 800px;">
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat:</strong> Preheat your oven to the highest setting (usually 250–300°C / 475–575°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, divide and stretch the dough into a 10–12 inch round. Try not to deflate the edges — keep a slightly thicker rim for the crust.</li>

            <li><strong>Add sauce:</strong> Spoon a thin layer of crushed tomatoes onto the dough, leaving a 1–1.5 cm border. Season the tomatoes with a pinch of salt if they need it.</li>

            <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> Scatter torn mozzarella pieces evenly over the sauce. Don’t overload — small gaps help the crust cook through and get bubbly.</li>

            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or baking tray and bake for 7–10 minutes (time varies with oven temperature) until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly charred.</li>

            <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Remove from oven, top with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Let rest for 1–2 minutes, slice, and serve.</li>
          </ol>
